# üî•üíßüå±‚ö° Guy's Pok√©dex Project - An Interactive Pok√©dex Using React Redux, React Router and PokeAPI

Guy's Pok√©dex Project is an interactive Pok√©dex (Pok√©mon encyclopedia) React app built by Guy Pollack.
It was created as my final project on my <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/front-end-engineer-career-path" target="_blank">Codecademy Front-End Engineer Career Path course</a>, bringing together the knowledge of React Redux, React Router, HTML, CSS and JavaScript that I gained during the course.
This was an open-ended project, and I chose to use [https://pokeapi.co](PokeAPI) as my data source because I have always loved Pok√©mon and thought it would be more fun and interesting for users to explore than, say, a weather or to-do list app!

## How Do I Use the App?

You can use the app at [https://pokedex-gp.netlify.app](https://pokedex-gp.netlify.app)

## What Features Does the App Have?

In Guy's Pok√©dex Project you can...

1. View all Pok√©mon released to date (as of 2023) on the Home Page, and filter them based on name, type, generation, height and weight. Within each filter category, you can choose whether the filtered Pok√©mon need to fit all the criteria, or any of them

2. View specific Pok√©mon's details on their own pages, by clicking a Pok√©mon on the Home Page

3. Create a user account. Note: no user data is stored by the app, and accounts are automatically deleted when you leave the app

After creating an account you can...

4. Add Pok√©mon to your favourites

5. Play the Who's That Pok√©mon guessing game

6. Update your account details

<strong>At any time you can also switch the app's formatting to Gameboy Mode using the slider at the top right of the screen, to enjoy a retro experience complete with Pok√©mon music!</strong>
